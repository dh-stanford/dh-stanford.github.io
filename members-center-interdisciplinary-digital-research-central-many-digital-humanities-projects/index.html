  <p>In advance of the upcoming &quot;<a href="http://shc.stanford.edu/events/humanities-digital-tools">Humanities + Digital Tools</a>&quot; panel discussion, the Stanford Humanities Center has produced a series of videos that detail the different exciting projects, many of which were created with support from or even led by members of the Stanford University Libraries' <a href="https://library.stanford.edu/research/center-interdisciplinary-digital-research-cidr">Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research (CIDR)</a>. Below, I've embedded the videos that feature support from Academic Technology Specialists and Digital Humanities Research Developers, all core members of CIDR. Rather than list the entire team for each project, I have only highlighted the contributions of the CIDR-affiliated members. Please watch the videos (listed in no particular order) to learn more about all the talented individuals who are working on these exciting projects.</p>
<p>Lacuna Stories features Mike Widner, the Academic Technology Specialist for the Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages</p>
<p>Palladio features Nicole Coleman, the Academic Technology Specialist for the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA)</p>
<p>Writing Rights <strong>also</strong> features Nicole Coleman.</p>
<p>Geography of the Post features Jason Heppler, the Academic Technology Specialist for the Department of History.</p>
