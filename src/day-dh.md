Today is the Day of DH, when digital humanities practitioners try to document what a "typical day" looks like in their engagement with digital humanities. There is an [official site that hosts blogs from self-identified community members](http://dayofdh2014.matrix.msu.edu/) and which, due to technical difficulties, I can't currently contribute to. But that gives me a moment to list the various Stanford folks who are taking part in Day of DH and highlight their blogs:


[Linguistics, Philosophy, & Textual Research Librarian Jacqueline Hettel's Day of DH](http://dayofdh2014.matrix.msu.edu/linguabrarian1/)


[Digital Humanities Librarian Glen Worthey's Day of DH](http://dayofdh2014.matrix.msu.edu/glenworthey/)


[Academic Technology Specialist Jason Heppler's Day of DH](http://dayofdh2014.matrix.msu.edu/jasonheppler/)


[Digital Humanities Research Developer Karl Grossner's Day of DH](http://dayofdh2014.matrix.msu.edu/computingplace/)


[Digital Humanities Specialist Elijah Meeks' Day of DH](http://dayofdh2014.matrix.msu.edu/elijahmeeks/)


If you are at Stanford and think of yourself as doing digital humanities scholarship, let me know and I will happily add you to the list.
