Developed at CESTA's [Humanities + Design Lab](http://hdlab.stanford.edu/), [Palladio](http://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/) is a widely-used web-based tool for visualizing data using networks and maps. You can save your work by downloading a file that you can upload to the Palladio interface when you return to it. While there is currently no easy way to embed Palladio visualizations in websites, CIDR staff are working on the documentation for how to use Palladio's visualizations in a stand-alone way. If you have time to help, please email Quinn at [qad@stanford.edu](mailto:qad@stanford.edu)!


### Palladio tutorials


We're collecting tutorials, guides, and examples for how to use Palladio -- particularly in the classroom -- to help people who are reconfiguring their courses to be online. If you have examples or write-ups that you're willing to share, please email Quinn at [qad@stanford.edu](mailto:qad@stanford.edu)!


* [Getting Started with Palladio](https://miriamposner.com/blog/getting-started-with-palladio/) by Miriam Posner. Often cited by other tutorials, this is a wonderful first introduction that first explains what Palladio is useful for (and where it's not as useful -- though a few things have changed since this was written in 2015), then walks through the process step-by-step with lots of screenshots.
* [Using Palladio and Gephi as Data Visualization Tools](https://www.allancho.com/2019/10/using-palladio-and-gephi-as-data.html) by Allan Cho. Blog post considering the pros and cons of different tools, with a series of detailed video tutorials for how to use Palladio.
* [Using Palladio to Analyze Historical Migration Patterns](http://blogs.ubc.ca/szhang/tutorials/) by Sarah Zheng. Describes a specific research use case, and digs into the question of how Palladio generates node size, with implications for how to understand Palladio graphs.
* [Using Palladio to Visualize Ads](http://ricedh.github.io/01-palladio.html) by Clare Jensen, Kaitlyn Sisk, and Aaron Braunstein. An example and tutorial for how to use Palladio to visualize the paths of enslaved people who had run away, based on ads taken out in newspapers.
* [Text & Data Analysis Part 2: Palladio Tutorial](https://taylorelysemills.org/tutorials/text-data-analysis-part-2-palladio-tutorial/) by Taylor Elyse Mills. Blog post has a link to a PDF, step-by-step tutorial for Palladio.
* [Analyze and Visualize Your Humanities Data with Palladio](https://publish.illinois.edu/commonsknowledge/2018/10/01/analyze-and-visualize-your-humanities-data-with-palladio/) by Kayla Abner. An overview of the major features of Palladio with examples of how you might use them.
