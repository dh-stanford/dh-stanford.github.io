title: "SUL Digital Humanities Project Support - Call for Proposals"

The **School of Humanities and Sciences** and **Stanford University Library** invite faculty and graduate students in all areas of the humanities to submit a research project proposal. Projects will be selected on the basis of their significance and contribution to the scholarâ€™s disciplinary field, theoretical and methodological sophistication, creativity of approach and technical innovation.


This support does not include any funding. Rather, project support awarded to successful applicants consists of library specialist staff and resources providing software development, project management, data modeling, and research support for a fixed period of time (typically 6-12 months, depending on the scope of the project).


In the past, this support has helped advance research of individual scholars as well as projects such as Mapping the Republic of Letters, and resulted in the creation of interactive scholarly works such as **[Kindred Britain](http://kindred.stanford.edu/)**, **[CityNature](http://citynature.stanford.edu/)**, **[ORBIS](http://orbis.stanford.edu/)**, and **[Authorial London](http://authoriallondon.stanford.edu/)**. The short proposals, which outline the scope and goals of the digital humanities project, are due on April 11th.





Suggested topics and areas include, but are not limited to:


* ***advanced data visualization applications***
* ***computer gaming and the humanities***
* ***historical geographic information systems (hGIS)***
* ***multimedia research***
* ***network analysis (geographic, social, citation, etc.)***
* ***textual analysis and text mining***

Interdisciplinary projects are especially encouraged.





Proposals will be evaluated by members of the Digital Humanities Steering Group/review committee for project support to begin starting in May 2014.
