In advance of the upcoming "[Humanities + Digital Tools](http://shc.stanford.edu/events/humanities-digital-tools)" panel discussion, the Stanford Humanities Center has produced a series of videos that detail the different exciting projects, many of which were created with support from or even led by members of the Stanford University Libraries' [Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research (CIDR)](https://library.stanford.edu/research/center-interdisciplinary-digital-research-cidr). Below, I've embedded the videos that feature support from Academic Technology Specialists and Digital Humanities Research Developers, all core members of CIDR. Rather than list the entire team for each project, I have only highlighted the contributions of the CIDR-affiliated members. Please watch the videos (listed in no particular order) to learn more about all the talented individuals who are working on these exciting projects.
