I just [wrote a piece on my blog](http://jasonheppler.org/2013/10/02/my-alt-ac-life.html) about the kind of digital humanities work I do at Stanford. Given the interest in [alternative academic careers](http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac/), I find it useful to share stories about the sort of work I'm doing, challenges I work on, and the collaborations I engage with in my career. My interest in alternative academic careers stemmed from my interest in digital humanities, hence the reason for this. I won't repost everything here, but [head over to the blog](http://jasonheppler.org/2013/10/02/my-alt-ac-life.html) if you're interested.
