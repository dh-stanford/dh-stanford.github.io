Over at my blog, I just [posted a piece](https://people.stanford.edu/widner/content/digital-humanists-lack-response-surveillance-state) about the role digital humanists should play in discussions of government surveillance. Some key questions:


Is there a chilling effect already in place? Are we afraid to speak out against the expanding erosion of privacy? Or are we already so reliant on Google, Facebook, and the other digital oligarchs that we have resigned ourselves to being watched by Big Brother's ever-vigilant eyes?


I won't repost here, so go read it there, if you're interested.
