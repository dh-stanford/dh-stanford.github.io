You are invited to attend “Russian Formalism and the Digital Humanities,” an all-day conference to be held Monday, April 13, 2015, at the Stanford Humanities Center.


The conference places quantitative literary analysis within the broader spectrum of 20th c. literary theory by comparing recent work in the Digital Humanities with Russian Formalism — long considered the foundational movement for modern literary theory.


Individual papers consider the place of objectivity in literary theory, the categories of formal analysis, and explore points of contact between Russian Formalist theory and work in the Digital Humanities in poetics, narrative theory, and literary history.
