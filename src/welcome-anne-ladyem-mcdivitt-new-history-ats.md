The Department of History and the Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research (CIDR), part of Research Data Services at the Stanford Libraries, are excited to announce that Anne Ladyem McDivitt will be joining us as the new Academic Technology Specialist (ATS) in History starting August 8th. The ATS positions are a partnership between the Libraries and a department which embeds a technology specialist with deep disciplinary expertise in a particular domain, in order to cultivate a local, digital methods-aware community through courses, workshops, consulting, and hands-on digital scholarship support for the department faculty and students.

The ATS position brings Anne Ladyem back to History, after serving as the Digital Humanities Librarian at the University of Alabama, where she advised and managed digital projects spanning a wide range of disciplines since 2018. Anne Ladyem received her PhD in History from George Mason University in 2018, with a focus on US history and a minor in digital history. As a graduate student, Anne Ladyem worked as a Digital History Fellow at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media. Her interests span from video game history to digital pedagogy to digital storytelling and public history. Anne Ladyemâ€™s office will be in History Corner (Bldg. 200, Rm. 246)  Please keep an eye out for further information regarding events to welcome her to campus.
