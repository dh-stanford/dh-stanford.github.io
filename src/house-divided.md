In this week’s post, I want to address a question that I have been asked quite often since coming to Stanford University Libraries, and one that made its way into a comment of [Michael Widner’s recent blog post](/debating-methods-matt-jockerss-macroanalysis)of the DH reading group's discussion of [Matt Jocker’s](http://www.matthewjockers.net/) new book, [Macroanalysis](http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/88wba3wn9780252037528.html): “I’m intrigued by the division within linguistics that Hettel describes; if there were a link to a blog post or something like that explaining it, I’d be interested in following up and learning more.” I searched online to see if someone had already written such a post and came up empty, so to help anyone out there who might want to understand these differences I have drawn [a basic portrait of computational language analysis on my blog (linguabrarian.com)](http://www.linguabrarian.com/a-family-portrait-of-computational-language-analysis/). Feel free to check it out if you're interested in a reductionist view of two basic divisions within the field of linguistics.
