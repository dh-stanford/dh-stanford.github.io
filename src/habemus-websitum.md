We Stanford Digital Humanists (a.k.a. DHers), scattered as we are [across campus](/about-dh-stanford), have long talked about uniting under the banner of a collective website.  Now we have: here it is, and [here we are](/people).


We'll highlight some of the [projects](/projects) we're involved in, whether completed or in progress; we'll introduce ourselves to, our interests, our activities, and our evolving organizational structure.  We use this site to announce workshops (like our upcoming [<digiPrep>](/digiPrep) series for the Stanford community) and other DH activities, whether at Stanford, in the [San Francisco Bay Area](http://sfbay-dh.org/), or in the [larger DH community](http://digitalhumanities.org).


Welcome!
