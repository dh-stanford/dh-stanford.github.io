Humanities + Digital Tools  

 Panel Discussion at the Stanford Humanities Center


Tuesday, May 5th at 2pm


 From visualizations of complex information and interactive teaching platforms to digitization projects and textual analysis, humanities scholars across campus are harnessing the power of digital tools to push the boundaries of their research. Likewise, the unique properties of humanities scholarship are pushing the boundaries of digital tools.


In this panel discussion, Stanford scholars and technical experts will talk about their work in the digital humanities. The conversation, which will be streamed live, will be moderated by Stanford Humanities Center Director Caroline Winterer and Zephyr Frank, Director of Stanford's Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA.)
