In the twentieth century, managing global issues in the era of modern, mechanized creation of reports generated bureaucracies such as the university itself, whose archives dwarf those of early modern Europe and invoke a need for new methodological strategies. Twentieth-century stories take place in the era of too much paper to read. Can digital tools provide shortcuts through these archives?


Jo Guldi will speak about her digital history research in the context of longue duree projects, foregrounding Paper Machines,[http://www.papermachines.org](http://www.papermachines.org/), a digital humanities toolkit for generalizing information about large-scale textual corpora.


Hosted by the Department of History and the Academic Technology Specialist Program.
