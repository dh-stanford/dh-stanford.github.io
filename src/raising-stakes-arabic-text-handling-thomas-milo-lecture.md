Date/Time: Friday, 7 February 2014 - 4:30pmLocation: Green Library - Information Center ClassroomEvent Link: [http://library.stanford.edu/news/2014/01/thomas-milo-raising-stakes-arabic-text-…](http://library.stanford.edu/news/2014/01/thomas-milo-raising-stakes-arabic-text-handling)

Join the Stanford Libraries for a fascinating talk by noted typographer Thomas Milo who will describe a project initiated by the Sultanate of Oman.


The project aims to display, search and quote Qur'ān text on the web in a typographically stable and orthographically flawless manner, regardless the operating system or the type of web device. This requires rethinking computer typography. After a general description of the project, two areas will be discussed in more detail:


* Scalable Vector Graphics technology will be evaluated as a candidate to stabilise computer typography. Browser deficiencies regarding SVG will be identified; SVG issues with Unicode will be identified.
* Typography issues regarding Arabic orthography in general and Qur'ān in particular will be identified, particularly the amphibious letters, not handled by any software to date.
* In addition to that a novel analysis of palaeographic Arabic script forms the basis for a new typeface to render the chapter headings.

The event is free and open to the public, but seating is limited. Please contact Sonia Lee <sonialee\_at\_stanford.edu> if you would like to attend.
