![](https://digitalhumanities.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj8071/f/styles/large/public/DARIAH-EU-Logo-ohne-Unterschrift-RGB.png?itok=bm4mn9Hc)The [first DARIAH Beyond Europe workshop](https://dbe.hypotheses.org/workshops/stanford), held at Stanford in mid-September, was for me a reintroduction to both [DARIAH](https://www.dariah.eu/) (the European digital humanities infrastructure organization) and Stanford’s digital humanities scene. I’d had the opportunity to engage with DARIAH in its early days, through my involvement with the ill-fated US cyberinfrastructure initiative [Project Bamboo](http://www.projectbamboo.org/) (and the short-lived [CHAIN: Coalition of Humanities and Arts Infrastructures and Networks](https://mith.umd.edu/chain/)); and again later, in 2014, when looking for an organizational home for the now-defunct DiRT tool directory (which has been incorporated into [TAPoR](http://tapor.ca/home)).


The biggest question for me, coming out of that workshop, was how, specifically, we should get engaged with DARIAH. If we reach out to [their working groups](https://www.dariah.eu/activities/working-groups-list/), would they be welcoming to interest from somewhat random Americans? Is it useful to anyone to add Stanford-internal courses to [their course registry](https://registries.clarin-dariah.eu/courses/)? Do they actually want feedback on the materials in [#DARIAHTeach](https://teach.dariah.eu/)?



At the time, I [wrote a blog post about being a “cowboy” and taking the next steps after the workshop](https://dbe.hypotheses.org/1479), and creating a mailing list on the spot for people who want to try to use DARIAH resources in their research and/or teaching. In the meantime, I’ve been trying to make time to engage with DARIAH, even as I acclimate to this new job, and plan for my digital humanities course next quarter (called “Digital Humanities Across Borders”, which will focus on non-English textual DH). One of the major projects I’ve been working on since I started at Stanford has been Prof. Kathryn Starkey’s “[Global Medieval Sourcebook](http://sourcebook.stanford.edu/)”, which will soon be relaunching. As such, it feels felicitous that the first DARIAH working group that responded to my inquiries was [Mediaevalist’s Sources (MESO)](https://www.dariah.eu/activities/working-groups/meso-mediaevalists-sources-sustainability/). Emiliano Degl’Innocenti, the National Coordinator of [DARIAH Italy](http://it.dariah.eu/) and co-lead of this working group, happened to be attending [DigitalHERITAGE 2018](http://www.digitalheritage2018.org/) in San Francisco, and I met up with him at a coffee break (where I told him I’d be the one wearing a [Glagolitic manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Assemanius)) to learn more about the working group, and what we might be able to do together. I [wrote it up for the DARIAH Beyond Europe blog](https://dbe.hypotheses.org/1899); see there for details.
