  <p>The <a href="https://dbe.hypotheses.org/workshops/stanford">first DARIAH Beyond Europe workshop</a>, held at Stanford in mid-September, was for me a reintroduction to both <a href="https://www.dariah.eu/">DARIAH</a> (the European digital humanities infrastructure organization) and Stanford’s digital humanities scene. I’d had the opportunity to engage with DARIAH in its early days, through my involvement with the ill-fated US cyberinfrastructure initiative <a href="http://www.projectbamboo.org/">Project Bamboo</a> (and the short-lived <a href="https://mith.umd.edu/chain/">CHAIN: Coalition of Humanities and Arts Infrastructures and Networks</a>); and again later, in 2014, when looking for an organizational home for the now-defunct DiRT tool directory (which has been incorporated into <a href="http://tapor.ca/home">TAPoR</a>).</p>
<p>The biggest question for me, coming out of that workshop, was how, specifically, we should get engaged with DARIAH. If we reach out to <a href="https://www.dariah.eu/activities/working-groups-list/">their working groups</a>, would they be welcoming to interest from somewhat random Americans? Is it useful to anyone to add Stanford-internal courses to <a href="https://registries.clarin-dariah.eu/courses/">their course registry</a>? Do they actually want feedback on the materials in <a href="https://teach.dariah.eu/">#DARIAHTeach</a>?</p>
<p>At the time, I <a href="https://dbe.hypotheses.org/1479">wrote a blog post about being a “cowboy” and taking the next steps after the workshop</a>, and creating a mailing list on the spot for people who want to try to use DARIAH resources in their research and/or teaching. In the meantime, I’ve been trying to make time to engage with DARIAH, even as I acclimate to this new job, and plan for my digital humanities course next quarter (called “Digital Humanities Across Borders”, which will focus on non-English textual DH). One of the major projects I’ve been working on since I started at Stanford has been Prof. Kathryn Starkey’s “<a href="http://sourcebook.stanford.edu/">Global Medieval Sourcebook</a>”, which will soon be relaunching. As such, it feels felicitous that the first DARIAH working group that responded to my inquiries was <a href="https://www.dariah.eu/activities/working-groups/meso-mediaevalists-sources-sustainability/">Mediaevalist’s Sources (MESO)</a>. Emiliano Degl’Innocenti, the National Coordinator of <a href="http://it.dariah.eu/">DARIAH Italy</a> and co-lead of this working group, happened to be attending <a href="http://www.digitalheritage2018.org/">DigitalHERITAGE 2018</a> in San Francisco, and I met up with him at a coffee break (where I told him I’d be the one wearing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Assemanius">Glagolitic manuscript</a>) to learn more about the working group, and what we might be able to do together. I <a href="https://dbe.hypotheses.org/1899">wrote it up for the DARIAH Beyond Europe blog</a>; see there for details.</p>
