The Great Migration was a watershed in African American life: over the course of six decades (1910-1970), six million black southerners left the South in search of more meaningful experiences of freedom. This project offers a different angle of vision on the migration by bringing to light the places where migrants slept, ate, got haircuts, and danced along the way.
