The Çatalhöyük Living Archive is a Stanford University digital humanities project, now in a pilot phase, aimed at making the data and interpretive works from that 20+ year archaeological project more accessible for ongoing and future scholarship. Çatalhöyük is a late-Neolithic settlement site on the Anatolian Plateau of south-central Turkey (occupied approx. 7500 BC to 5700 BC).
