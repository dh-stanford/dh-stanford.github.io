  <p>This talk series hosted by Quinn Dombrowski (DLCL ATS at Stanford) and Liz Grumbach (Arizona State University) brings together DH scholars from around the world in the virtual space of Animal Crossing, in order to discuss something new: a new article, a new project, a new book, or another new undertaking.</p>
<p>Anyone who has the Nintendo Switch game Animal Crossing and a Nintendo Online membership can RSVP to the events and attend &quot;in person&quot; in the virtual space. For those who would prefer to watch the event streamed to their computer or device, we'll <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/acndighum">stream live on Twitch</a>, and anyone with an internet connection can watch there and ask questions.</p>
<p>We're still working out the details, but if you'd like to present your work on the show, please email Quinn at <a href="mailto:qad@stanford.edu">qad@stanford.edu</a>, or get in touch with us on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/acndighum">@ACNDigHum</a>!</p>
<p>Graphic design and publicity for <em>Animal Crossing: New Digital Humanities</em> is brought to you by Lauren Whitby of the Institute for Humanities Research at Arizona State University.</p>
