  <p>In this week’s post, I want to address a question that I have been asked quite often since coming to Stanford University Libraries, and one that made its way into a comment of <a href="/debating-methods-matt-jockerss-macroanalysis">Michael Widner’s recent blog post</a>of the DH reading group's discussion of <a href="http://www.matthewjockers.net/">Matt Jocker’s</a> new book, <a href="http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/88wba3wn9780252037528.html">Macroanalysis</a>: “I’m intrigued by the division within linguistics that Hettel describes; if there were a link to a blog post or something like that explaining it, I’d be interested in following up and learning more.” I searched online to see if someone had already written such a post and came up empty, so to help anyone out there who might want to understand these differences I have drawn <a href="http://www.linguabrarian.com/a-family-portrait-of-computational-language-analysis/">a basic portrait of computational language analysis on my blog (linguabrarian.com)</a>. Feel free to check it out if you're interested in a reductionist view of two basic divisions within the field of linguistics.</p>
